# Project Suggestions
Here is the list of project suggestions and their descriptions.
### Implementation of DS algorithms in multiple programming languages
  In this project you would implement the data structure algorithms (stack, queue, trees, etc.) in any one of different programming language and by analysing the difference in the computational time and efficiency this would present an excellent way to show which programming language is suited for which kind of algorithms. A few suggestions of popular programming languages these days are – Python, JavaScipt, Julia, Scala, C#, R, ruby, etc. Choose whichever language you find interesting.
##### This project is of medium difficulty and you would have to first learn a programming language followed by implementing the DS algos in that language.
### Dodger
  Several bad guys fall from the top of the screen, and the user must avoid them. The player can be controlled with the arrow keys or more directly with the mouse. The longer the player lasts without being hit, the higher the score. Add some variations by making enemies fall at different rates and be different sizes. Have enemies fall from more than one side of the game. Have power up pickups that grant invulnerability for a while, slow down bad guys, give the player a temporary "reverse bad guys" power, etc.
##### This is a medium-high difficulty project that would require in depth understanding of how such games are made. For directions try visiting [this site](https://inventwithpython.com/dodger.zip?27f655).
### An app that uses camera to identify the species of plants, fruits, and flowers
  You would first need to build a model which identifies plants, fruits, and flowers and presents with the history of that plant (using automated google search or something) and weather conditions necessary for its growth. Once completed this part (using machine learning) try integrating this model in an interactive app.
##### This project is actually quite difficult and some might even have trouble completing this one in time, but if you want to learn new things and get your hands dirty with machine learning this one is for you.
### Professor Schedule Management System
  Professors usually find it difficult to keep hold of their time table and all the material they have taught in the class or intend to teach in subsequent lectures. This management system intends to solve that issue by helping create a time table for the professor on his mobile phone itself. This time table wouldn’t just tell the professor which batch he has to teach and in which room, but would also keep the material (ppts, class notes pdfs, etc.) he has taught already along with those that he intends to teach in the upcoming lectures.
##### This is a medium difficulty project best for people who want to get started in android development.
### Highly Confidential Security System
  Develop an application for storing file, images , audio , video ,etc. in a secure way. Use an advance and almost non- crack-able cipher(Blowfish, AES, etc.) to encrypt data(text data & media-file) before caching them in a password protected locker.
##### This project has medium difficulty. If you are even slightly interested in cybersecurity and stuff, this is the project for you.
###  Simon
  Four colored buttons light up in a specific pattern. After displaying the pattern, the player must repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in proper order. The pattern gets longer each time the player completes the pattern. If the player presses a wrong button, the game ends.
##### This project again, just like the dodger game app is of medium-high difficulty. Follow [this link](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapter5.html) to get started.
### Pdf Enhancer
  We often see that whenever we try to download pdf files from the internet, by default the system provides a random string of numbers or letters as the pdf name. This is because by default browsers are set to extract the name of the book using the meta data available in the pdf. This project seeks to resolve this problem by ensuring that the downloaded pdf has the same name as the title of the book. As an extension to this project try writing a python script that – using regular expressions – bookmarks the entire books into different chapters.
##### This is medium-high difficulty project. You would get to learn a lot of cool new stuff about how pdf viewers and browsers work under the hood.
### Sentiment Analysis
  People write reviews of products they just brought, the process of quantifying their reviews on the scale of 1 to 10 can either be done by a human being or be automated to do by itself. The automated version of the task is accomplished by using machine learning algorithms. The trained model will predict whether the user liked using the product or hated the experience and based on that prediction mark the rating value of that review (with 10 being the best and 1 being the worst).
##### This is a medium difficulty project. You will need to read atleast one machine learning algorithm (Naive Bayes) and dataset.
### MP3 Extractor from you-Tube
  Develop an application or plugin that can extract audio from any Youtube video. In this process you would learn how to create plugins for different browsers like chrome, firefox, etc.
##### This is a medium difficulty level project.
### Zip Password Crackers
  Any File Can be unzipped through the command line, providing password as an argument. So, write a simple brute force program to generate permutations (possible passwords) and send it to command line, creating and running shell script. Run until you receive a success return call, that's it, the simple Zip Password Cracker Project is ready.
##### This is a medium-easy project idea and would help you learn about shell commands and zip files. These are abstruce topics but would be helpful to know as a software developer.
### Voice based E-mail for the Blind
  Blind people often go through a lot of trouble handling their bussiness life. You can make it a bit easier by making an application that lets visually impaired people to write the contents of the mail by converting speech into text and send the email directly to the person they want to send the email to.
##### This is a medium difficulty project. With smart use of libraries you can make your work easier and with creative thought you might make the life of blind people easier.
### E-commerce price comparison
  It is an enervating job to find the best deal for a product that you find really interesting. This project intends to solve this problem by automating the process of comparing the prices of the product on various popular e-commerce website and providing the comparing and user reviews of different websites in a coherent way.   
##### This is a medium-high difficulty project. You would learn multiple new concepts like web scrapping and API by doing this project.
### College attendance system
  This project is intended to automate the attendance procedure by using a fingerprint sensor and OTP generation system. This system wouldn’t just help monitor the attendance of students in the class but will also allow the administration to know which teachers skipped which classes. One of the possible ways to implement this project is by making a system that accepts the attendance of a student only if – he/she is connected to the same wifi router as the professor. Types in the pin generated on the professor’s mobile (which he will declare in the class) which is valid for a period of 5-10 mins. And registers his/her thumb impression using their individual phones.
##### This is one of the difficult ones. This would require indepth knowledge of security encryptions, android development among other things.
