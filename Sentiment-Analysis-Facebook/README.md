This project aims to develop an application which performs sentiment analysis over closed social network communities.
The sentiment analysis objective will be channelized by applying standard machine learning techniques to the user activity data. 

• The application uses Graph API (Facebook Developers) to tokenize and extract data from www.facebook.com
• The extracted JSON (data) is processed by using data manipulation and cleaning techniques, handled in Python.
• The processed data is fed to Google Cloud API and analyzed using NLP and Computer Vision techniques.
• GUI is developed using Tkinter library in Python.
